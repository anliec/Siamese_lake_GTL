# Siamese_lake_GTL
siamese network experimentation for my special problem of spring 2018

## Structure

This repo contains the core code around the siamese neural network. It is divided into three main parts:

 - The siamese network trainner in the [siamese_network](./siamese_network/README.md) directory
 - The GUI displaying the result of the training in the [evaluator](./evaluator/README.md) directory
 - The jupyter to annalyse convergence speed and so on `plotter.ipynb`

Please refer to the readme of each directory for more information.
